# 🧪 Drug Discovery Projects

This repository contains a collection of computational drug discovery projects that apply machine learning, cheminformatics, and bioinformatics techniques to model compound-target interactions, identify therapeutic leads, and explore structure–activity relationships (SARs).

The goal of this repo is to build reusable, scalable, and interpretable pipelines for **ligand-based and structure-based drug discovery**, leveraging publicly available datasets and open-source tools.
